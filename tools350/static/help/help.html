            The best place to get help is the documentation, which you can find at
            <a href="/static/downloads/Assembler_Documentation.pdf">this link</a>.

            <h2>Help Quickstart</h2>
            Some basic pointers that might help with common errors
            <ul>
                <li>You may only have one jump/branch target per line. Because of how the assembler works, though,
                    you can place a target-only line right after your first target and they'll both map to the same
                    line.</li>
                <li>There is no need for the normal MIPS structure with data and text fields. Simple write the
                    instructions you want into a file directly. See the examples in the documentation .</li>
                <li>Labels cannot be purely numeric, and they cannot they use any of these:<br>( ) : ; $ ,</li>
                <li>The assembler does no error checking on your supplemental files. Make sure they adhere to the
                    spec laid out in the documentation</li>
                <li>If the assembler gives you a "KeyError", it likely means you attempted to use an instruction that
                it didn't recognize. Make sure that your code is correct and try again.</li>
            </ul>
